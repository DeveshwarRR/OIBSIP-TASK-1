# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification using Machine Learning

A machine learning project to classify Iris flowers into their respective species (setosa, versicolor, and virginica) based on their measurements.

## 📝 Project Overview

This project implements a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers using the famous Iris dataset. The model learns from four key measurements:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

## 🎯 Objective

The main goal is to create a robust machine learning model that can accurately predict the species of an Iris flower based on its measurements.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset contains 150 samples with:
- 50 samples of Iris setosa
- 50 samples of Iris versicolor
- 50 samples of Iris virginica

Each sample has four features (measurements in centimeters):
1. Sepal Length
2. Sepal Width
3. Petal Length
4. Petal Width

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
